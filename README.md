# mono-ts-starter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/monolist/mono-ts-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/monolist/mono-ts-starter)

A boilerplate for starting and publishing a TypeScript npm module.

## Overview

This is a relatively simple boilerplate providing the tooling for testing and building a TypeScript module
in preparation for publishing on NPM.

It does not provide out-of-the-box support for third-party libraries such as React. However, hey should be fairly straight-forward
to add without anything like Webpack.

## Getting Started

1. `git clone https://github.com/monolist/mono-ts-starter.git`
2. Get started writing your module!
